## Blog: Setup

You're going to build a `Blog` application to learn more about Phoenix and Ecto.

```
$ mix phx.new blog
$ mix ecto.create
```

blog posts should have a `title`, `subtitle`, and `content`. It should also have relevant timestamp information.

```mermaid
classDiagram
  class Post {
    title: :string
    subtitle: :string
    content: :text
  }
```

Use [Phoenix Generators](https://hexdocs.pm/phoenix/Mix.Tasks.Phx.Gen.Html.html) to generate the Controller, Context, and other infrastructure for the post resource.

<details style="background-color: lightgreen; padding: 1rem; margin: 1rem 0;">
<summary>Example Solution</summary>

Generate the resource.

```elixir
$ mix phx.gen.html Posts Post posts title:string subtitle:string content:text
$ mix ecto.migrate
```

Then add the resource to `router.ex`.

```elixir
scope "/", BlogWeb do
  pipe_through :browser

  get "/", PageController, :home
  resources "/posts", PostController
end
```

</details>

## Bonus: Validation

Add the following validation rules to your `Post`.

* `:title` must be between `3` and `50` characters.
* `:subtitle` must be between `3` and `100` characters.

Ensure these validations are enforced when you create or edit a post.

## Bonus: Skip the Generators

To solidify your understanding of Phoenix, recreate your blog application without using generators.

## Commit Your Progress

Run the following in your command line from the curriculum folder to track and save your progress in a Git commit.
Ensure that you do not already have undesired or unrelated changes by running `git status` or by checking the source control tab in Visual Studio Code.

```
$ git checkout main
$ git checkout -b exercise-blog_setup
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "finish blog setup exercise"
$ git push origin exercise-blog_setup
```
